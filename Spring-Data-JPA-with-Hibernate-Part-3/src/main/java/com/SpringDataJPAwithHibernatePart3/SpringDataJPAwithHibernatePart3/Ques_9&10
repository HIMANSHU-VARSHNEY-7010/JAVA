Which method on the session object can be used to remove an object from the cache?
	# We can use session evict() method to remove a single object from the hibernate first level cache.
	# We can use session clear() method to clear the cache i.e. delete all the objects from the cache.
What does @transactional annotation do?
	# A Transaction represents a unit of work performed within the database management system against a database.
	# We generally group the related work within one transaction so that if part of the work is failed
		then entire transaction should be failed.
	# We can use @Transactional to wrap a method in a database transaction. It allows us to set propagation,
		isolation, timeout, read-only, and rollback conditions for our transaction. We can also specify the
		transaction manager.
	# We mainly use @Transactional to do the modification operations in DML.
	# So when you annotate a method with @Transactional , Spring dynamically creates a proxy that implements
		the same interface(s) as the class you're annotating. And when clients make calls into your object,
		the calls are intercepted and the behaviors injected via the proxy mechanism.
